Thank you for downloading Dante. 

Dante requires: 
* An operating system that is capable of running PHP 5.1.2 or better. (Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8, Linux or OSX)
* A user smart enough to actually read the manual

Notes:

Dante will not run on any version of PHP 4

If you alreay have PHP 5+, you don't need to install it again provided you have the sockets extension enabled. 

Don't install php to a folder with a space in it!
The batch file doesn't like it.

Now you can read the Manual for installantion.

If you are programming for the bot please read this.

There is documention in the `docs' folder.
There is a `params.txt' for the output of the breakPacket function.
There is a `Module How To' RTF that explains some things about modules.
There is the PHP manual at php.net

Look at those. There are plenty of examples in the various modules included with the bot. 
Then you can bother the poor programmer that actually bothered to write all of the documentation for the bot. 
He didn't have to do it. :)
